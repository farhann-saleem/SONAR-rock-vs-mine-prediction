🎯 Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project is a simple binary classification system that predicts whether an object detected by sonar signals is a rock or a mine.

It uses Logistic Regression as the machine learning model.

📌 Project Overview

Preprocesses the sonar dataset.

Splits data into training and testing sets.

Trains a Logistic Regression model.

Predicts whether the input is Rock (R) or Mine (M).

Evaluates the model using accuracy score.

⚙️ Technologies Used

🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sonar-rock-vs-mine.git
cd sonar-rock-vs-mine


Install dependencies:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn


Run the model:

python sonar_prediction.py

📊 Example Output
Training Accuracy: 83.6%
Test Accuracy: 76.1%

Prediction for sample input: Mine

📁 Dataset

The dataset is Sonar Data Set (UCI Machine Learning Repository).

Each row represents sonar signals bounced off either a rock or a mine.

✅ Features Completed
